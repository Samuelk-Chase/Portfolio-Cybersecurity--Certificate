#### Example Secuirty Risk Assessment Report 

## Scenario: 
- You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future. 
- After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:

1) The organization’s employees' share passwords.
2) The admin password for the database is set to the default.
3) The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.
4) Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used. 

- If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future. 

## Part 1 Three hardening tool and methods to implement: 
- From the four vulerabilities the best options to help harden the social media organizations network are: 
1) Password Policies
2) Multifactor Authentication (MFA)
3) Firewall maintenance 
## Part 2 Explain your recommendations: 
- The reason I chose those three tools is as follows: 
-First the passowrd polocies would advise against employees sharing passords as well as implimenting the NIST recomendations making it harder for and actor to brute force their way in. The password polocies would also change the admin password for the data base to a more secure option. 
-Secondly The Multifactor authentication should be used because, currently its not, but also it would help further protect against brute force attacks and can be implimented right away and once set up can be lighly maintained. 
-Finally the firewall maintenance tool should be used because rules can be updated in response to futrue events and they would track abnromal network traffic and would help protect agains various DDos attacks.
